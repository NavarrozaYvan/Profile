                Hi, I'm Christian Ivan C. Blanca.
                My goal is to become a proficient web application
                developer with a strong foundation in Java development
                I aim to master front-end and back-end technologies,
                including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java frameworks,
                to create dynamic and user-friendly web applications.
                I aspire to contribute to innovative projects that
                enhance user experiences and solve real-world problems.
                Over the next few years, I plan to gain practical
                experience through internships, contribute to open-source
                projects, and continuously expand my skills by learning
                emerging technologies and best practices in web development.
